# Code Quality
- Clear, idiomatic, maintainable; descriptive names; **strict typing**.
- Small, composable functions; avoid over-engineering.
- Focused diffs; no whitespace-only changes.
- Prettier on save; fix or justify linter warnings.
- Follow existing project conventions/patterns.
- Choose appropriate data structures; call out Big-O for hot paths.

## Example
- Hot path note: O(n log n) sort acceptable for ≤100k items; otherwise switch to counting/radix when keys bounded.
